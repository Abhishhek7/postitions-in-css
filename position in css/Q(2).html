<!--Explain the difference between Absolute and Relative positioning.
ABSOLUTE: syntax {
    position:absolute;
}
An element with position: absolute; will cause it to adjust its position with respect to its parent. If no parent is present, then it uses the document body as parent.



RELATIVE: syntax{
    position: relative;
}
Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of an element with position: relative; property will cause it to adjust from its normal position. The other objects or elements will not fill the gap.
